This is a simple template I made because I struggle with responsive typography.
Everything within the `.basil` class has its font sizes changed based on `em`s. The `.basil p` object also has its font size changed by default. The font sizes are not meant to be perfect, only useable as a starting point. Adjust accordingly.
Check the sample `index.html` file for usage.

To use, download `basil.css` or `basil-min.css`.
